M480-HW6-Diffie-Hellman-Key
===========================

<b>Problem 1: Agree on a Diffie-Hellman Key </b><br>
I'm Michael and you're Nikita. We choose p to be the *next* prime after 2^127-1. I compute my secret m and tell you that Mod(2,p)^m is 89646952373925749567894332598989134553. You compute your secret n to be "123456", and thus tell me that Mod(2,p)^n=158950970901130875643663016511694449147. 

<b>What is the secret number that we agree on?</b>
